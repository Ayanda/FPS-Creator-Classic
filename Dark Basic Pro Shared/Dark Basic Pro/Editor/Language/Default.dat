; Language file for TDK_Man's Dark Basic Professional IDE. 

; This file may be translated to any language and each one saved as 'languageX'.txt 
; on disk for convenience, but whichever version is supplied with the IDE, it must 
; always be called Default.dat and stored in the Lang folder. 

; Each legitimate entry line MUST start with a 3 character code in the format 'X: ' 
; where X is the type of data stored. For example, M: is a main menu entry and S: 
; is a sub-menu entry for the Windows menu system. The actual data MUST start at the 
; 4th character on each line.

; All comments MUST start with a semi-colon (;) but can be removed from the final 
; Default.dat file if desired.

; The following codes are used in this file:

; M: Main Menu entry
; S: Sub-Menu Entry (drop-down entry)
; W: Windows Caption Entries (Title Bars)
; D: Dialog Box Captions
; G: General Form Text
; H: Button Hints
; C: Combo Box List Entries
; T: Tabs
; L: Labels

; Finally, remember that all entries are tied to options in the IDE. Do NOT add or 
; remove ANY entries or all subsequent options in the IDE will be incorrectly labelled.


; Windows Menu Text:
; ------------------

; If translating into another language, place an ampersand (&) immediately before the 
; letter you wish to be the keyboard shortcut for that menu entry. Note that only one 
; M: and one S: entry can use the same shortcut keyboard letter when translated.

; All Main-menu entries are listed first, followed by their drop-down entries.
